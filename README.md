## Simple attempt at working with Apicurio Registry

it contains 
- a Node.js RESTful api (using Express) with its own OpenAPI Specification
- ~~a Go RESTful api (using [chi](http://github.com/go-chi/chi))~~

Setup: make sure your Apicurio Registry is exposed at http://localhost:8080/apis/registry/v3

### Next steps: 
- client creation (using Kiota)
- client creation (using `openapi-generator-cli`)
